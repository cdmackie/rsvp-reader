# Speed Reading with QuickReader

This is a **sample Markdown document** for testing the QuickReader application.

## What is RSVP?

RSVP stands for *Rapid Serial Visual Presentation*. It's a technique that displays text one word at a time at a fixed point on the screen.

### Benefits

- **Faster reading**: Eliminate eye movement
- **Better focus**: One word at a time
- **Adjustable speed**: 100-900+ WPM

## How It Works

The **Optimal Recognition Point** (ORP) is the letter in each word that your eye naturally focuses on. QuickReader highlights this letter in red and centers it, so your eye never needs to move.
