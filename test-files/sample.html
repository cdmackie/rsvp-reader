    <h1>Welcome to Speed Reading</h1>

    <p>This is a <strong>sample HTML document</strong> for testing the QuickReader application. It includes various HTML elements to verify proper parsing.</p>

    <p>The text contains <em>italic formatting</em> and <b>bold formatting</b> to ensure these styles are preserved during RSVP display.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Speed Reading</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Read books faster</li>
        <li>Improve comprehension</li>
        <li>Save time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>RSVP technology displays words one at a time at a fixed focal point. This eliminates the need for eye movement, which is one of the main bottlenecks in traditional reading.</p>
