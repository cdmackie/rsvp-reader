# Markdown Formatting Demo

This sample demonstrates how QuickReader handles **Markdown** formatting in the preview panel while maintaining smooth reading flow.

## Text Styling

You can use **bold text** for emphasis and *italic text* for titles or foreign words. Combine them for ***bold italic*** when needed.

Inline `code` appears in the preview but is skipped during reading, keeping technical documents readable.

## Lists and Structure

Here are some benefits of speed reading:

- Increased reading efficiency
- Better time management
- Improved focus and concentration
- Greater information retention with practice

Numbered steps work too:

1. Load your document
2. Adjust the speed to your comfort level
3. Focus on the red letter
4. Let the words flow naturally

## Blockquotes

> The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.
> — Dr. Seuss

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are displayed in the preview but not read aloud:

```javascript
function readFaster() {
  return practice + focus + patience;
}
```

## Paragraphs and Flow

Long paragraphs work seamlessly. The application automatically paginates content for comfortable reading sessions. Each page contains roughly 250 words, creating natural stopping points without interrupting your flow.

Whether you're reading documentation, articles, or books, the RSVP technique helps you consume content faster while maintaining comprehension. The key is consistent practice and gradually increasing your speed as you become more comfortable.

## Conclusion

This demo shows that formatted documents remain fully readable. The preview panel displays rich formatting while the reader focuses on one word at a time. Try adjusting the preview panel width in settings to find your preferred layout.
